# Walmart Retail Dataset
## by Arikanawasi Udoka


## Dataset

The Walmart Retail Dataset was gotten from Tableau Public, I chose this dataset because I am somewhat familar with it and it fits the dataset options guidlines.

The dataset contains the following columns: customer_segment, discount, order_date, order_priority, order_quantity, product_base_margin, product_category, product_container, product_subcategory, profit, region, sales, ship_date, ship_mode, shipping_cost, state, total_cost, order_date, ship_date, product_base_margin, discount, customer_name, customer_age, zip_code, order_id, row_id, number_of_records, unit price


## Summary of Findings

After doing exploratory analysis I found out there was a difference between order counts and order quantity as a row can have over 40 order quantities. I took this into coginizance during my intial exploration using Univariate charts.
As most of the features I focused on were categorical I wanted to see which region, product category and state had the highest number of orders.
In subsequent explorations, Biavariate, I used the order count to see were most of the orders were coming from and it turns out that they were mostly in the Central region across all product categories.

Outside of this I also looked at which shipping mode was favored by customers and it was Regular air both by Order Quantity and Order count but there was an Exception in Furniture were Delivery Trucks were preferred for deliveries.

At the end of my exploration I discovered that the West region spent the highest amount of money in one product category: Technology which didn't stand out at beginning nor middle of my exploration.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For this presentation I'll focus more on Product Category, Region and Order Count/Order Quantity.

I'll start by introducing the Product Category and Order Count/Order Quantity with a bar chart then with a pie chart to show how it isn't a good chart to visualize the data we want to see.

Then we'll move on to Region and Order Count/Order Quantity using another bar chart as we are still trying to see which has the highest.

Next we'll see the Product Category and Order Count/Order Quantity by region to see how these relate and if there are any changes to what we saw previously.

Finally, I close out with the scatter plot showing how there's a stark difference when another variable not previously used changes how we view the data.
